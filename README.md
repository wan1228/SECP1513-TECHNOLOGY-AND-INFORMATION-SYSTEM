**REFLECTION**

**INDUSTRY TALK AND VISIT**

**1. Overview of ICT Jobs in Clarity Techworks Sdn. Bhd.**
I learn that essential skills aren‚Äôt just skills that only involves us physically. Soft skills form the foundation for effective teamwork, enabling individuals to navigate challenges, communicate clearly, and work harmoniously towards common goals. They are not only essential for personal growth but also play a pivotal role in fostering a positive and productive work environment, contributing significantly to individual and collective success. I would like to suggest an improvement about the talk which is to give us more input about the challenges that they are facing in the company. Lastly, I think every positions such as Android Developer, Q&A Analyst plays a crucial roles in terms of building the company.

**2. Virtual Talk on ‚ÄúUTMDigital ‚Äì Our Digital University Driver‚Äù**
I learn that UTM Digital has each of their own department such as Division of Digital Innovation, Digital Architecture, Infrastructure Architecture and Strategic Architecture to ensure the smoothness of any data transmission and development in UTM. I would like to suggest an improvement about UTM Digital to create a much more user friendly interface on UTM website which collect all UTM platform on one page. Lastly, I think UTM did a great job in enhancing their system by times with latest equipped technologies.

**3. System Development @ Credence (TM Subsidiary)**
There are multiple technologies that have been used in Credence‚Äôs system development for each section such as for the Database/ Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) section for data entry,storage, and retrieval. Database management solutions enable users to handle vast amounts of data. I would like to suggest an improvement about the talk which is to give us more input about the challenges that they are facing in the company. Lastly, I think Credence values varied career paths in analytics, from business analysts to data scientists, and emphasizes a supportive workplace culture, encouraging open communication, continuous learning, and celebrating success. 

**4. Industrial Visit to Indah Water**
On January 3, 2024, we went to Indah Water Konsortium Research Centre to have an insightful session about the technologies that are being used such as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), a software programme for regulating industrial processes that gathers data in real time from remote places to regulate equipment and conditions. It manages the treatment process in real-time, keeping their facility compliant while ensuring efficient plant operation 24/7. I would like to suggest an improvement about the visit where they will show us how they operated the system in real life. Lastly, I think it's incredible for Indah Water to adapt these green technologies in their company.

**PC ASSEMBLE**
The process of constructing a working computer system from compatible parts, which usually include the motherboard, CPU, RAM, storage devices, and peripherals, is known as PC assembly. This procedure makes future upgrades and maintenance simpler while offering customisation, cost savings, and the chance to learn about computer technology. I would like to suggest an improvement where we could learn on how each part of the components work. Lastly, I think it was complicated at first on how to assemble the PC but it's definitely worth it to take a peek what is actually inside the computer.

**DESIGN THINKING**
Empathy, creativity, and iteration are key components of design thinking, a human-centered approach to problem-solving. It entails comprehending user demands, coming up with creative solutions, and quickly developing and testing concepts to provide workable solutions. We created Kanri, the managing app that allows user to organize their subscription plans.I would like to suggest an improvement where we wish we could not just stop the app development just for this assignment, but for wider audience out there. Lastly, I think it's necessary to follow all the design thinking setps to ensure the success to develop anything.
